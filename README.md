Welcome to **your** repository for your GitHub Learning Lab course. This repository will be used during the different activities that I will be guiding you through. See a word you don't understand? We've included an emoji ðŸ“– next to some key terms. Click on it to see its definition.

Hi, IÕšm Manuela, a freelance web-designer working
in Sao Paolo & Paris.
I create websites, packaging, 
retail concepts, illustrations
and everything in-between.

Just dive right in...

This course is using the :sparkles: open source project [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/). In some cases weâ€™ve made changes to the history so it would behave during class, so head to the original project repo to learn more about the cool people behind this project.
